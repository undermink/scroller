# scroller.py
This is a simple sidescrolling platformer I just wrote to relax after work. (And I mean relaxing by writing it not playing...)
I drew most of the images on paper then digitalized them, but I made most of the animation with GIMP only... no digital pens or a mouse - just my t460s with it's trackpoint :D, hehe

## usage
If you have pygame installed you can just run the `scroller.py` without any arguments...
Otherwise you'd have to install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) first.

### keys
Once the game is up and running you can control by pressing:

a ---> kick or use a weapon (if you have one)
s ---> switch weapon
q ---> quit the game
← ---> go left
→ ---> go right
↑ ---> jump
